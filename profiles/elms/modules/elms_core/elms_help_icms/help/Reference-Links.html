      <p>ELMS Reference Links allow to associate external links as a batch to content.  You could also accomplish this by just creating links through the text editor but this allows them to be quantified separately.  One use-case for this is augmenting an existing course's content with newer findings / articles / resources.  You can also use it almost as a "want to learn more" type of approach as these links will all be aggregated back into a link under Course Resources.</p>    </div>
