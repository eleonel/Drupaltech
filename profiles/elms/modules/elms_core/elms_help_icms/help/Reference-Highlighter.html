      <p>Reference Highlighter is a unique way of improving the experience associated to your courses in ELMS.  To utilize Reference Highlighter, go into the ID Toolkit and turn on some features like Places, Timelines, Terms and others.  Then go to some content in your course version and select text on the page.  You'll see a small popup toolbox with different options based on what features you have active.</p>
<p>Clicking on one of the icons will streamline the association of material to the content you are currently working with.  ELMS then figures out what associated material should be displayed on the page and builds out tabs that organize that material off to the side of the screen.  Clicking on the previously highlighted text (now a link in the content) will open up the tab and jump to the material in question.</p>
<p>Currently this is just for content authors but future plans are to allow for the ability for students to highlight and leave notes on the course content in a similar manner.  This note taking could even be structured as a participation activity or just as a way of enhancing the student experience.</p>    </div>
