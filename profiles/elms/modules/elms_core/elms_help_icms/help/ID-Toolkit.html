<p>The ID Toolkit is how an instructional designer can craft the experience of this version of a course.  By default there are only a few tools turned on: ELMS Content and ELMS ID Best Practices.  These defaults can be changed and you should play around with the other tools (also known as features) you can activate as they can enhance the experience of students in your course.</p>
