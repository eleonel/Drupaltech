        <td>E-Learning Management System (ELMS) is the name of the Drupal based distribution that is this system.  Development under the ELMS brand originally started in 2007 and continues today in a much more sophisticated form.  ELMS is much more then a content platform, it is a platform for developing systems as part of the "Suite of Tools" instructional design philosophy for rethinking the traditional LMS.</td>

      </tr><tr><th class="elms_col1" scope="row">Instructional Design Templates</th>
        <td>Structures that make up the initial best practices of a course.  These can be created by developers so that instructional designers and instructors can select how many lessons they want and what structure to use as a template.  The ID Template then creates the outline and populates it with sample content (optional). This is important for rapid prototyping of courses.</td>
      </tr><tr><th class="elms_col1" scope="row">Course Content</th>
        <td>A Feature that helps bundle together everything related to the creation and management of the course content outline.  This was the original reason for creation of the ELMS platform.</td>
