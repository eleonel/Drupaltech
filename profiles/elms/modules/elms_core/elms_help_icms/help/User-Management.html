<p>User management has a variety of options in ELMS.  You can individually add users to a version, drop them individually or use one of the bulk methods such as XML import or CSV.  Because this is built on Drupal it's very easy to construct ways of importing users in a more automated fashion, so consider the XML/CSV methods as examples of how to accomplish that rather then the only way of accomplishing it.</p>
