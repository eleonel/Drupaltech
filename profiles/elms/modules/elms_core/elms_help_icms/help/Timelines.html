<p>ELMS Timelines allows you to associate time points to content.  It uses a library for displaying the time points called SIMILE.  To add a time point, highlight text in content and click to make the association.  Put in the start and end point for the time and save.  You will now have a tab as well as highlighted text that's associated to the timeline.</p>
<p>Timeline also appears under Course Resources which will display the aggregate of all time points for this course version.  This can provide a very unique way of back-link navigating through content or reviewing everything learned in a course visually.</p>
